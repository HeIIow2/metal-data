- Metal genres must be "X Metal", with each word capitalized.

- ; is used to distinguish between genres from distinct periods of time.
For example X Metal (early); Y Metal (later) would mean the band played X Metal early on, but then changed to Y Metal later on.

- / is used to describe a mix of genres.
For example X Metal/Y Metal would mean that the band plays a mix of X Metal and Y Metal. The order does not matter.
NOTE: All but the last "Metal" typically gets truncated, so it becomes X/Y Metal for simplicity's sake.

- ; and / can be used at the same time.
For example X Metal/Y Metal (early); Z Metal (later) means the band played a mix of X Metal and Y Metal early on, but then changed to Z Metal later on.

- , is for cases where a band has played two or more distinct genres, which may not be split into distinct periods of time.
For example X Metal, Y Metal indicates the band has played both X Metal and Y Metal throughout their career, no limitation on time.

Consider the difference between a band that has "Power/Thrash Metal" as its genre and another band that has "Power Metal, Thrash Metal" as its genre. In the case of the former, you can assume the band played some mix of power metal and thrash metal. Indeed, that is actually a thing. In the latter case, you can assume the band has albums which are power metal and other albums which are thrash metal, and they may be spread out across the band's discography. The band must be pretty versatile, but at least they keep the styles apart.
